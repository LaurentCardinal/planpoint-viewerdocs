## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when setting up your group project.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm unable to combine the different phases of the project into a group project">
    Please ensure that you have already created the group project and each individual phase of the project. Once everything is set up, simply click the box that appears when you hover your mouse over each individual project on the dashboard. Select all the phases you wish to add to the group project, and proceed to add them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why aren't the chosen colors for my group project showing up?">
    Please make sure that at the end of the URL in the preview link, you add: **?customColors=a** 
    This ensures that the system recognizes and applies the color preferences youâ€™ve set for the group project. If this parameter is not added, the default color will be displayed instead of your custom colors.
