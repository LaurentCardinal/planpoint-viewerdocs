Themes control the visual style and layout of your Planpoint project viewer. Each theme is prebuilt and ready to use, allowing you to present your project in a professional and consistent way without custom design work.

Themes define how your listings, units, floorplans, and project details are displayed to users across desktop and mobile devices.

## What are themes?

A theme is a predesigned visual layout that determines:

- Overall page structure and layout
- Typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- How units and listings are displayed
- Interaction patterns and UI presentation
- The overall look and feel of your project

All themes are responsive and optimized for modern browsers and devices.

## **How to Access and Apply Themes**

Follow these steps to access themes in your Planpoint dashboard:

1. From your dashboard, click Style & Embed at the top of the project. If you are already inside a project, navigate to Settings → Style & Embed.
