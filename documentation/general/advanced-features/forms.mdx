The Forms module allows you to create fully customizable forms to collect information from users interested in a specific unit. Forms can be embedded directly into your project flow, supporting advanced customization, logic rules, previews, and multi-language translations.

This module is commonly used for:

- Lead capture
- Unit inquiries
- Reservation requests
- Contact and information collection

### Enabling the Form

To activate a form for a project:

1. In your dashboard, go to Sales & Marketing. From there, you will find the Form module.

2. Toggle Enable form to ON.

Once enabled, the form becomes available in the project flow and can be customized.

## Form Configuration

To customize your form, click Edit to open the Form builder. The builder is divided into four main sections:

- Designer
- Preview
- Logic
- Translations

### Designer

The Designer tab is where you build and configure the structure of your form.

### Form Title and Description

- Form title: Defines the main heading of the form.

  Example: Request info about unit unitName

  Dynamic variables like unitName are supported.
- Title visibility: You can choose whether the title and description are visible to end users.

### Form Language

- Select the default language for the form. Available default languages are English, Spanish, French, and German.

### Display Settings

- Form display mode
  - Editable: Users can fill in and submit the form.
  - Read-only: Form is visible but cannot be edited.
- Form width mode
  - Auto: Adjust automatically to layout.
  - Static: Fixed width.
  - Responsive: Adapts to different screen sizes.

### Fields and Questions

You can add and configure multiple field types, including:

- Single-line input

### Logo and Header

You can upload a logo to display in the form header, helping mantain brand consistency.

### Navigation and Pages

- Organize the form into multiple pages
- Control navigation between pages
- Define the overall flow of the form

### Validation

Set validation rules to ensure users provide correct and complete information (e.g. required fields, email format).

### Thank you page

After submission, users are shown a confirmation screen. You can customize:

- Thank you message
- HTML markup
- Button text

## Preview

The Preview tab allows you to see exactly how the form will appear to end users before publishing.

- View the full layout
- Test field behaviour
- Confirm images, text, and button placement

This is especially useful when testing different screen sizes and layouts.

## Logic

The logic tab lets you define conditional rules that control the form flow.

### Logic Rules

You can create rules based on user input to:

- Show or hide specific questions
- Control navigation between pages
- Customize the user journey dynamically

To create a rule:

1. Go to Logic
2. Click Add New Rule
3. Define the condition and resulting action

If no rules are created, the form follows a linear flow by default.

## Translations

The Translations tab aloows you to manage multi-language versions of the form.

### Supported Translations

You can translate:

- Form title
- Button text
- Than you page content
- Questions labels

Each language is managed side by side for easy comparison and editing.

### Language Management

- Add or remove languages
- Enable only selected languages
- Keep English as default fallback

This makes Forms ideal for international or multi-region projects.

## Form Image

You can upload a Form Image that will override the main project image and be displayed alongside the form in preview and live views.

## Email Settings

Forms support email language configuration, allowing notification or automated messages to match the selected form language.

## Custom Reservation Flow

For advanced use cases, you can define a Custom Reservation Flow, including a custom confirmation message after submission.

If no custom message is set, the default confirmation behavior is applied.
