### How to embed

Planpoint can be embedded into any kind of website, from custom HTML/CSS/JS to platforms like Webflow, SquareSpace, Wix or WordPress. A Planpoint embed code is simply a few lines of HTML and JavaScript.

Paste the code where you want your Planpoint Viewer to appear. The Planpoint Viewer will obey the width of the parent element in which it's placed in. The height is established by the content inside the viewer. For example, if the building image's proportions are more vertical than horizontal, Planpoint Viewer will occupy more height on your page. You can stylize the parent element however you see fit, for example by adding padding or giving it a fixed width.

    <Info>Assign a permanent namespace and hostname before embedding the code. If these are modified, the code will cease to function, necessitating the need for re-embedding.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3">
    A new window will open up with the live preview of your current project. Test your plan viewer and make changes accordingly. You will need to reload the preview in order for changes to take effect.

  <Step title="Step 4">
    Once you're satisfied with your plan viewer, simply select the desired language **output** and **theme**, and click on **Click to copy**.

    * You can export as many instances of your plan viewer as you wish, in 5 languages (English, French, Spanish, Chinese and German). Each language will have it's own script to copy-paste.

  <Step title="Step 5">
    Once you have finished with embedding and hosting, you can proceed to the **Style** section. Here, you can choose whether you want your plan viewer to start with a grid or list view. The number of images per row in the grid view can be adjusted to 2, 3, or 4.

    The floor overview allows you to see, from the main render of your project, how many available units are on the floor you are hovering over. Additionally, if you choose to hide the drawing lines, the polygons you've drawn for the exterior of your project, as well as those for the floor plans, will disappear.
