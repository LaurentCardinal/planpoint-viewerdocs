    The **Button Information** section allows you to customize the text displayed on the payment button in the plan viewer. Additionally, you can upload an SVG file to use as an icon. 
    The **Statement Descriptor** explains the charges or payments that appear on your customers' bank statements.
    The **Success Payment** allows you to provide a title and description to communicate the details of the reserved unit to your clients.
    Once the user clicks the Payment button, the unit status will switch to **On Hold**. This status is temporary and unique to this process. It will remain On Hold for X minutes or until the user completes the payment, at which point the status will update to Reserved or Purchased.
