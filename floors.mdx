  <Step title="Step 1">
    After drawing the polygons for a floor, and if other floors share the same floor plate, you can clone the drawings. This will help speed up the process by duplicating the drawn polygons.

  <Step title="Step 2">
    After choosing the floor you wish to copy from, it will serve as the reference floor, and its drawings will be cloned. You may choose as many floors as needed. Enabling the **Clone Floorplan** option will copy both the drawings and the floor plans from the selected floor.
