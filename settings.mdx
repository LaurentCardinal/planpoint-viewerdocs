    Assign a project name, address, choose the project type (sales, rental, land, commercial), and select whether you want to skip the floor or not. This allows you to jump directly from the project render to the unit you choose to view. This feature is typically used for small projects.

    Choose the specific plan for this specific project. Plans are based on the number of **units per project.** Larger real estate projects require a larger monthly plan.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4">
    Under **details** you can do the following:

    * Define a cover image. This is the image that will appear in the card preview of the project in the dashboard and will also be your main building image. Please choose a high-resolution image, but no bigger than 1 MB.

    * Edit the project's name.

    * If you wish, you can add the website URL of your project, which will redirect you to the project's website.

    * You can also add an internal URL for the project. This is intended for your marketing and sales teams.

    After finishing with the project details, move on to the **customization** tab. Here you can do the following:

    * Select the property type (Condominium, rental, townhouse, house, land, retail, office, commercial, industrial).

    * Turn on/off prices. When turned on, the plan viewer will show each unit's price.

    * Turn on/off availabilities. When turned on, the plan viewer will specify wether each unit is available or not.

    * Turn on/off freely the unit information. This includes inclusions, parking, orientation, bathrooms, descriptions, finishes and more.
