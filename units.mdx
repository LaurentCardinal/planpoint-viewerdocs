    <Note>Download the [Excel template here](https://app.planpoint.io/assets/template.xlsx). The download button, located next to the upload button, allows you to download a CSV file of the current unit list. This feature is particularly useful if you need to make bulk updates to the unit list and re-upload it to update the project.</Note>

    Please view the following video to understand how to prepare your Excel file before import:
