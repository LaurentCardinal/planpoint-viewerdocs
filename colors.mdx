The Color module allows you to customize the color palette of the plan viewer so it better reflects your brand and visual preferences. You can define colors for key interface elements, including the background of the viewer, hover interactions where floors and plans are highlighted, buttons and button text, general text, and unit status indicators such as available, reserved, sold, and featured.

These colors are applied consistently across the project, including interactive areas when users engage with the exterior building image. All changes are applied immediately, allowing you to preview and fine-tune your styling in real time. Colors can be set using any HEX or RGB value, providing full flexibility and precision.

If you want to edit your color scheme, simply follow the instructions below:

<Steps>

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    Once there, select **Color Scheme**.

    <Frame>
      ![](/colors2.jpg)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can make use of transparency by using the transparency slider as you see in the video below. A slightly transparent color is preferable over a completely opaque one, as it will show some details about the building and floor plan.
